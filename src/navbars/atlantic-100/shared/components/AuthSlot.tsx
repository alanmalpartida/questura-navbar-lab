/**
 * The navbar's right-hand control, in a box that is the same size before and
 * after the session request answers.
 *
 * `/api/me` is a client call and the public pages are statically cached, so
 * the navbar cannot know who is reading until after hydration — there is no
 * server render that could get this right. What it can do is stop the answer
 * from moving anything. This slot is always as wide as the widest control it
 * can end up holding, so the Subscribe button beside it paints once, at its
 * final position.
 *
 * The signed-in menu is the widest at every breakpoint — 58px against "Sign
 * in" at ~35px below 480, 68px against ~43px above it — so its size is what
 * the slot reserves. Measured in the browser at 375px and 1280px, 2026-09-20.
 *
 * Before this the slot had no width at all while loading, and the Subscribe
 * button jumped 58.7px to the left the moment "Sign in" arrived.
 *
 * While loading, the slot holds "Sign in" marked `nav-signin` + `data-pending`,
 * so an anonymous reader gets it in the same frame as Subscribe. A reader this
 * browser last saw signed in has `<html data-identity>` set by the pre-paint
 * hint (`lib/user/identityHint.ts`), and foundations.css hides the pending
 * control — visibility, not display, so the reserved width stays. Once
 * `/api/me` answers the marker is gone and React alone decides.
